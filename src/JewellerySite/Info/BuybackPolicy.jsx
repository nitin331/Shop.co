        <p>Though we are confident this situation will never arise, we have taken care of it.</p>
        <p>We have a lifetime free no questions asked buyback and exchange policy.</p>
        <p>The exchange value will be calculated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Engine Parts: 100% of the market value</li>
          <li>Body Parts: 80% of the market value</li>
          <li>Labor charges: none</li>
          <li>GST: none</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In case you wish to raise a request for a buyback and exchange, you are requested to write an email to <a href="mailto:support@sparedrive.com">support@sparedrive.com</a> with your order number, invoice, photograph of the product, and the authentication certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once our team takes a preliminary check on the product being in good condition, we will send an email confirmation and arrange for a pickup from your address. You are requested to hand over all the products, invoice, and certificates in the same box with proper packaging back to the pickup executive. Once the box reaches our office, our team will undertake a thorough check of the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once it passes the quality check, we will issue a credit note as per value above. You can purchase a new product within 90 days of the credit note issuance. The quality check will also involve ensuring the authentication of the spare part shipped versus returned, using the unique identification number (UIN) that is mentioned in the certificate and inscribed on the part. No wear and tear, re-work, alteration should have been done on the products for them to be eligible for this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case the product is damaged on receipt or the UIN does not match, your buyback request will be rejected. Our team will contact you for further information. The Companyâ€™s decision regarding the quality check shall be final and binding on the customer. Under no circumstances will the Company return money to the customer.
